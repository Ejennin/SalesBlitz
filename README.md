SALES BLITZ, and app setup to do group face to face calls on an individual territory over a one or two day period. 
The purpose is to blanket the market and give that territory a quick boost to sales funnel. Ideally, a day or two will be add to a district meeting and as a group/team pay it forward by helping out a team member. 

The app will use a SalesForce API for Accounts and scheduling Appointments.
Eventually the app can include Geo mapping and a mutual calendar to schedule Follow up calls by the host.

The app is designed to automate a process that I once performed manually.
I'd determine what territories were in need of a boost based on performance and the current trend, particularly any special circumstances, like loss of major account. 
Set up a date based on monthly meetings, get involvement and leads from internal partners that service and maintenance  accounts. 
	Organize teams.
	Schedule tentative appointments with intent of:
	Introductions
 	Drop off gifts
 	Qualify accounts
 	Determine decision maker
 	Schedule followup appointment. 
 	Team Building
